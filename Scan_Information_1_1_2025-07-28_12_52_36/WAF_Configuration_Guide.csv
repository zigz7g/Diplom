XML injection,"The application writes data from an untrusted source to XML file. This allows an attacker to change the structure and content of the file. Applications typically use XML to store data or for messaging. In the first case, XML file is treated as a database and can contain valuable data. Web applications can also use massaging via XML for valuable data exchange. An attacker who has the ability to write data to the XML document can change its semantics. In the most harmless case he/she can inject excess tags into the document, whereby the XML-parser exits with an error. In more serious cases, an attacker can add XML elements changing the authentication data, change data (such as prices, if we are talking about a database of a store). In some cases, XML Injection can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) and remote code execution.",,,"To turn on attack tracking/blocking mode, you need to configure the resource that is to be protected in the LTM module as a virtual server and apply the ASM module policy to it. 1. Applying ASM policy to a protected resource: 1.1. Go to “Security → Application Security → Security Policies → Active Policies” in F5 BigIP Web interface. 1.2. In this section, you will see the ASM policies. 1.2.1. If the ASM policy is already enabled for the server: 1.2.1.1. Click on the name of the server. 1.2.1.2. The window opens, in which you will see the Signature Staging Enabled (Attack Signatures Configuration) field. 1.2.1.3. Click on the (Attack Signatures Configuration) link to navigate to the signature configuration mode. Other option: click on the “Security → Application Security → Attack Signatures → Attack Signatures Configuration” link and select the virtual server in the upper left corner. In this section, you can add the necessary sets of signatures. 1.2.2. If ASM policy is not available for the desired server, then in the upper right corner click on ""Create"" button and set up the configuration by answering questions of the system. During the setup, the system asks you about the type of the protected resource and based on this creates a primary set of signatures that is most suitable for this type of server. 2. Connecting Generic Detection Signatures. 2.1. Select the needed set of signatures on the right and click on the “<<” button to copy it to Assigned Signature Sets. After that the set will be displayed among Assigned Signature Sets: 3. After setting up the necessary sets for a virtual server, press the ""Save"" button to save the changes and click “Apply Policy” button to apply the settings to traffic processing. Without pressing the ""Apply Policy"" policy will work with the previous set of signatures. Click on the set to see the entire list of signatures in the set. In the lower left window all monitored parameters will be displayed.","To enable tracking of attacks of this type in PT Application Firewall, you need to: 1. In the main menu, go to the Configuration section and select Security > Policies. 2. In the policy field, click on the Edit icon. 3. Go to the Protectors tab. 4. Select the XML Protector option and click on the module. 5.Configure rules and security events settings if needed. 6. In the Rules and Security Events section, select all the security events for the XML Protector module (make sure, they are active). 7. Click Apply.",sdk-9.0.200/test/dotnet-pack.Tests/PackTests.cs:224
